# Automatic_Vacuum
## Description:
For the Mech 202, teams were created with the goal of building a vacuum from scratch that can run by the push of a button. The vacuum should be capable of picking up a variety of debris, including sand, washers, nails and marbles.

## Package Contents:
- G-code: used to print off the designed parts that were ultimately printed for the project
- Arduino Code: Used to program the arduinos and get the vacuum to actually function and move

## Please Note:
As of October 18th, 2022 this is a work in progress and there is still lots of time to go before competition day
