# Automatic_Vacuum
## Description:
For the Mech 202 class, teams were created with the goal of building a vacuum from scratch that can run by the push of a button. The vacuum should be capable of picking up a variety of debris; including sand, washers, nails and marbles. The requirements are highlighted in the project description document.

## Package Contents:
- G-code: used to print off the designed parts that were ultimately printed for the project
- Arduino Code: Used to program the arduinos and get the vacuum to actually function and move
- Project Description Document: Official rules and regulations for project

## Competition Results:
The competition was held on November 13th, 2022. The vacuum created placed 4th out of 17 with a loss in the final round by ~20 grams of sand and debris.
