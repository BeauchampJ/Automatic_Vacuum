# Arduino Code
## Description:
This contains all of the arduino code used for this project including the actual code and any testing scripts which were produced during this coding process
## Contents:
- Primary Code: This file is the primary code used by the arduino during actual opperation. It includes the setup variables and all sensing information
## Future Changes:
- [x] Test to see if soldering works well in conjunction with this code
- [ ] Update this page to include breadboard breakouts
- [x] Power switch code
- [x] Add code to have robot turn around
