## G-Code
## Description:
This is all of the geometry code used to 3D print the designed solidworks parts for our device. The code can be loaded to a printer and executed. The slicer used was PrusaSlicer and the printer used to produce the parts was an Original Prusa i3 MK3 by Josef Prusa
## Package Contents:
- Base.gcode: The primary body of our vacuum cleaner. It had to be cut into two pieces to fit on the printer bed, so it will need to be attached using an adhesive of some kind. 
- Shelf.gcode: The shelf used for catching debris from the battle arena. Made to be easily removable
- Top_Lid.gcode: This is the top cover for our vacuum to hide the internals.

This is the full assembly for the vacuum which was designed in Solidworks
## Future improvements:
- [ ] Add the brush that we ultimately use
- [ ] Add to the README for clarity
